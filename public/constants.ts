      "I’m grateful to the Newton Scholarship Nexus for the transformative mentorship class I’ve been part of. 🙏 Thanks to this program and God’s grace, I’ve seen life from a new perspective. The strategies and support shared have been invaluable  as they pushed me to excel. Mr. Dave Newton would always say, “If success is achievable, why settle for less?”, and honestly these words sparked something in me and I achieved my first-ever 5.0 CGPA!",

      "What I’m about to express is just a fraction of the impact,and that’s factual. The Newton Scholarship Nexus (NSN) has played a truly transformative role in my scholarship journey since 100 level. Beyond promoting academic excellence, NSN has shaped my mindset; teaching me persistence, hope, and the power of consistency, even after multiple rejections.",

      " 400 level …boom! I finally secured not one, but two scholarships, after years of trying!This was no coincidence,it was preparation meeting opportunity, backed by NSN’s influence and God’s Grace. And I know this is just the beginning. NSN has taught us not to settle for mediocrity but to chase excellence relentlessly. Thank you, NSN, for shaping my journey and creating real impact in my life and many others",
